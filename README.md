Example of an application using a standalone Envoy proxy for handling request authorization inbound and auth token header injection for outbound requests.

This demo is meant to show how envoy can add capabilities to a microservices architecture in a way that is minamally invasive by use of the sidecar pattern within a kubernetes pod.
